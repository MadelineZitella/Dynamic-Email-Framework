# Dynamic-Email-Framework
This repo includes a fraction of some of my work to create a dynamic email framework as a part of my project as a software engineer intern. I implemented a database table using TypeORM, holding email field information ('to', 'from', 'subject', etc) and email templates. The templates were constructed with HTML and Nunjucks, allowing dynamic field editing. Instead of updating hard-coded subject or recipient variables, for example, email contents can now be updated within the database GUI without running migrations or waiting for code deployment or hotfixes. NotificationService.ts interfaces with EmailFields.ts to render email information based on the email type, before sending the email message.
